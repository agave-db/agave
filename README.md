# Agave DB

An in-memory server for storing data structures. It is partly Redis-compatible, allowing you to use the Redis CLI, but the goal is not to clone Redis.

Agave was created in response to some of the common complaints about Redis in production:

- Redis is single-threaded, so its vertical scalability is quite limited â€” once you reach a throughput limit, you can't simply give it more CPU
- Expanding beyond the capacity of a single CPU core requires clustering, which is a lot more complicated
  - Redis clustering puts significant constraints on key naming
  - Cluster-mode in Redis pushes a lot of the complexity out to the client drivers, which then have to delegate that complexity to the client applications
  - Redis clustering and replication are _entirely separate concepts_
- While Redis _can_ represent data types other than just strings and arrays with RESP3, and there was a plan for Redis 6 to drop support for RESP2, the vast majority of the Redis ecosystem still depends on RESP2

## Data Types

Agave supports storing and serializing all of the following data types:

- Strings
- Integers
- Floats (IEE754 double-precision)
- Booleans (true/false only)
- Arrays (lists implemented as arrays) of any of these types
- Sets of any of these types
- Hashes mapping string keys to values of any of these types

All collection types (arrays, sets, and hashes) are automatically created when adding to them and deleted when the last item is removed. This avoids the need to clean them up yourself.

Other data types planned:

- Sorted sets (experimental implementation is already included in the codebase, implemented with a Red-Black tree)
- Streams

## Multithreading

Agave does not yet support multithreading, but it's being worked on. There is a locking mechanism for commands to use, but it's unnecessary in Crystal's single-threaded mode.

## Installation

### Install from source

First, you'll need to install the Crystal compiler.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/agavedb/agave
cd agave
shards build
```

## Usage

```shell
bin/agave
```

## Development

All commands have access to the following:

| Expression | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `command` | `Array(Agave::Value)` | The full deserialized command array |
| `key` | `String` | The name of the key to operate on. Defaults to `command[1]`. |
| `data` | `Hash(String, Agave::Value)` | The hash containing all keys and their values |
| `expirations` | `Hash(String, Time)` | A hash which maps keys to their expiration timestamps |
| `lock(key : String)` | `Nil` | A method that acquires a lock for the given key before executing its block and releases the lock after the block completes |

### Implementing commands

To implement a new Agave command, define a file with its name in the `src/commands` directory.  For example, if you want to define an `UPCASE` command, you would create a file `src/commands/upcase.cr` with the following:

```crystal
require "../commands"

# Command: UPCASE key value
Agave::Commands.define upcase do
  check_expired! key
end
```
